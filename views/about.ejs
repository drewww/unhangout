            <p><strong>Unhangout</strong> is an open source
            platform for running large scale online un-conferences.
            We use Google Hangouts to create as many small sessions
            as needed, and help users find others with shared
            interests.</p>

            Think of it as a classroom with an infinite
            number of breakout sessions. Each event has a landing
            page, which we call the lobby. When participants
            arrive, they can see who else is there and chat with
            each other. The hosts can do a video welcome and
            introduction that gets streamed into the lobby.
            Participants then break out into smaller sessions (up
            to 10 people per session) for in-depth conversations,
            peer-to-peer learning, and collaboration on projects.
            UnHangouts are community-based learning instead of
            top-down information transfer.
