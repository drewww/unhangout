			It’s easy to get started. We will work with you to create the event page. And you can embed a sign-up form (using google forms for example) to collect email addresses from your participants.

		Each event starts in the lobby. If you are the organizer, you can embed a Google Hangout on Air to welcome the participants and let them know how the event will unfold. Participants can use the chat window to talk with each other or ask questions. Check out the list of sessions on the left, and reserve a space by clicking on “Sign Up”. (Pro tip: the avatars on the right keep track of who is actively looking at the page. If they go grey, the user is looking at another window).

	<h4> Breakout sessions </h4> 

	<div class="step-description">

	<i class="step-icon icon-signin icon-4x"></i>

	<p> 
		When the event organizer gives the go ahead, all the sessions start automatically. A pop up window will appear with a link to the break-out group you registered for.

			You are then connected into a Google Hangout window for your break-out group. Think of this as a small satellite that circles around the lobby room. You can always go back to the lobby (don’t close the window).

	<p> 
		Even if you didn’t reserve a spot before, you can now still join any group that has space. The buttons on the session list change from “Sign Up” to “Join”. You can also jump from session to session (but remember, you can only ever be in one Google Hangout break-out window).

	<h4> Wrap-up webinar and chat </h4> 

	<div class="step-description">

	<i class="step-icon icon-thumbs-up icon-4x"></i>

	<p> 
		The event organizers can call participants back to the lobby by joining their hangouts (Note: In future, you’ll be able to send a broadcast message into all active satellites). Typically there will be a short wrap-up, and users can leave comments and say their good-bye’s in the chat.
